    "scratchpad": "The concept of a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach to enhance large language model capabilities is fascinating. By leveraging the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a layered architecture, the MoA methodology has shown impressive results on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK. The idea that LLMs can generate better responses when presented with outputs from other models, even if those other models are less capable, is an interesting phenomenon that warrants further exploration. The distinction between proposers and aggregators in the MoA framework adds a layer of complexity to the model, allowing for more nuanced and sophisticated response generation. The experimental results, which demonstrate substantial improvements over individual models and state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, are compelling. The analysis of the internal mechanisms of MoA, including the effects of model diversity and the number of proposers, provides valuable insights into how this approach works. The budget and token analysis, which highlights the cost-effectiveness of MoA, is also an important consideration for practical applications. Overall, the MoA approach seems to offer a promising direction for improving the capabilities of large language models.",

We construct a MoA with multiple layers, each comprising several LLM agents. Each agent processes the input text and generates a response, which is then presented to agents in the next layer for further refinement."

        "text": "We observed that LLMs tend to generate better responses when presented with outputs from other models, even if those other models are less capable.

Proposers generate useful reference responses, while aggregators synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality output. We use a layered architecture, where each layer consists of multiple LLM agents. The outputs from one layer are presented to the next layer for further refinement."

        "speaker": "Guest",
        "text": "Yes, that's a valid concern. However, our results show that MoA can be more cost-effective than using a single large model. For example, MoA-Lite, a variant of MoA that uses fewer layers and a smaller aggregator, achieves a 1.8% improvement in quality on AlpacaEval 2.0 while being more than twice as cost-effective as GPT-4 Turbo."
