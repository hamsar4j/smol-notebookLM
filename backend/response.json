    "scratchpad": "The input text discusses a new approach called Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) that leverages multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve their collective performance. The MoA methodology involves constructing a layered architecture where each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from the previous layer as auxiliary information to generate its response. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK. The text also explores the concept of 'collaborativeness' among LLMs, where models generate better responses when provided with outputs from other models. The authors conducted extensive experiments to validate their approach and provide insights into the internal mechanisms of MoA.",
