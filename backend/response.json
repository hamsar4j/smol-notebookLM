    "scratchpad": "The input text discusses a new approach called Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) that leverages multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve their collective capabilities. The MoA methodology involves constructing a layered architecture where each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from the previous layer as auxiliary information to generate its response. The paper highlights the 'collaborativeness' phenomenon among LLMs, where models generate better responses when provided with outputs from other models. The authors conducted comprehensive evaluations using benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results show significant improvements, with MoA achieving a 65.1% score on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to GPT-4 Omni's 57.5%.",
